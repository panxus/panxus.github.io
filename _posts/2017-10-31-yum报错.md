###### yum报错

1. yum报错处理:

```
File /var/cache/yum/i386/6/epel/metalink.xml does not exist
```

2.解决[来自stackoverflow]

```
Actually.. Are you using CentOS 6 or CentOS 7? You seem to have EPEL7 configuration files. You can't use EPEL7 with CentOS 6.

If you are using CentOS 6, try this:
yum remove epel-release --disablerepo=epel\*
(check /etc/yum.repos.d to see there aren't any epel repo files in there at this point)
yum install epel-release
```
